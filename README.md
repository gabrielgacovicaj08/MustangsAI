Accessing university-specific information currently requires manual navigation through the university’s website—a time-consuming and cumbersome process, especially for new and prospective students. The purpose of this research is to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that dynamically responds to user queries about Midwestern State University (MSU) by drawing upon a specialized knowledge base containing MSU-specific information. To do so, we develop a ChatGPT-inspired website tailored specifically to MSU, enabling rapid and accurate responses to frequently asked questions regarding university policies, D2L, academic departments, in-person/online university resources, and program offerings by employing an advanced natural language processing framework. 

The RAG approach integrates two main components: a retrieval module, which efficiently fetches relevant information based on the user’s query, and a generation module, powered by GPT, which synthesizes the retrieved information into coherent and contextually relevant responses deployed on a custom website interface.

Methodologically, we preprocess publicly sourced data for the external knowledge base using vector embeddings, enabling the system to perform semantic similarity searches. The generated output is then tailored by GPT, drawing upon retrieved content to produce relevant responses.
Preliminary findings indicate that the RAG model produces highly accurate, relevant, and efficient results. We anticipate that this RAG-based solution will improve information accessibility for current and prospective students, providing them with answers to university-specific questions with a higher degree of efficiency and simplification.
